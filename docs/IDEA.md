Building a weather station is an excellent project—real-world, embedded, sensor-heavy, and covers a lot of ground in hardware and software. Here’s how you can approach it:
Core features for your embedded weather station:

    Sensors to include:

    Temperature (e.g., DS18B20 or LM35)

    Humidity (DHT22 or similar)

    Atmospheric pressure (BMP280 or BME280)

    Optional: light intensity, wind speed/direction, rainfall sensor (if you want to get ambitious)

    Microcontroller:

    AVR (ATmega328P) or ESP32 (for Wi-Fi connectivity if you want)

    Data display:

    LCD or OLED display for local readout

    Optional: serial output or wireless transmission to a PC or server

    Power:

    Battery powered or USB power supply

    Consider low-power modes if battery-powered

    Data logging:

    Store readings on an SD card or external EEPROM (optional)

    Timestamp data using an RTC module (DS3231)

    User interface:

    Buttons to cycle through data views or configure settings

Steps to build your weather station:

    Choose and connect sensors: Learn how to interface each sensor individually.

    Read sensor data: Write code to poll sensors and interpret data correctly.

    Display data: Output values on a screen or via serial communication.

    Implement data logging: Save readings with timestamps.

    Add power management: Implement sleep modes if using batteries.

    Optional: Add connectivity (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) to send data remotely.

    DOCUMENT EVERYTHING!
